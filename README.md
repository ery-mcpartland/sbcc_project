Loop calculations for the nonleptonic parts of b to s decays mediated by 2 c quarks
are stored here

Files contained are:

1-loop_calculations.nb - a mathematica file for computing some of the integrals for the by hand calculation

1-loop-sbcc-processes.nb - a mathematica file that uses Package-X to perform 1 loop integrals

Automated_sbcc_processes.nb - a mathematica file that automates the Package-X 1 loop calculations

2-loop-sbcc_processes.nb - a mathematica file that calculated and manipulates the numerators for some 2 loop processes

There is also a folder of redundant files
